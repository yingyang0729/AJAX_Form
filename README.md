## Contributing
The contributor is Ying Yang. The folders and the files can be annotated as follow.
1. Based on Professor Trevor's class, I fixed all problems at first with JS and Vue js. I changed the mail.js. After I fixed all problems, there were no alert on the pages.
2. I changed the style of the page with SASS and imported files from SASS folder to index.html.
3. I brought a domain and a host [from free host no ads](https://freehostingnoads.net/).
4. I changed the PHP file based on the Professor Justin's class files. I added some commands on the PHP files so my host can send the email for clients.
5. I tested the host so many times. All the results of tests were good. The send mail address is "message@yingyangdesign.com", and the gmail shows the message on my test email box.
    Here is a screenshot for the received email ![iamge](https://github.com/yingyang0729/Yang_Ying_AJAX_Form/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-11-26%20154526.png).
  


## History
TODO: 
The project is done but the speed is so slow. Here is some tips.
1. After you write the contact form, you wait for 30seconds to 1 minutes and you can see the result on the web page. 
2. You check the email and you can see the email in your email box. Here is the screenshot of the email. ![image](https://github.com/yingyang0729/Yang_Ying_AJAX_Form/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202022-11-26%20154620.png)
3. It will be fast on the midnight or the morning time. Afternoon time is so bad and you only can see the result on the page but you cannot receive email. Here is the result of the page.
